# Stride Jobs
This is a repo for the work that STRIDE students Maddie Wettach and Samantha Ho are using working with [Simon Halliday](http://simondhalliday.com) (Smith College).
Data work will involved the ISSP 2005 and 2015 data as well as the WERS data. 
Neither of these data sets will be hosted on github, but eventually the project will be full reproducible. 

##Folder Structure
The basic folder structure for the project will be a slightly modified version of that used for [Project Tier](projecttier.org). 

- The Data folder will contain a folder for the Original Data and for the Analysis Data and meta data.
- The CommandFiles folder will contain R Markdown files and R scripts that we use to analyze the data and to create visualization.
