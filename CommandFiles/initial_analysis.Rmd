```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Requrements for the analysis we do
Make sure that you have these packages installed. If you don't have them installed, then run `install.packages("packagename")` in the R command line (not in this R Markdown file) to install them on your computer. 
```{r requirements, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(stargazer)
library(mosaic)
```

## Read in the data
Maddie/Samantha: I didn't check whether I've labeled these correctly, but I presumed that the data with later versions (v2.1) is the one for 2005. Am I right?. 

```{r read_data}
ISSP15 <- read_dta("../Data/OriginalData/ZA4350_v2-0-0.dta")
ISSP05 <- read_dta("../Data/OriginalData/ZA6770_v2-1-0.dta")
```
